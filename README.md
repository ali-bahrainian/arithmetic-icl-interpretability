# Interpretability Analysis of Arithmetic In-Context Learning in Large Language Models

This repository will host the code for reproducing the experiments presented in our paper:
> **Interpretability Analysis of Arithmetic In-Context Learning in Large Language Models**
> Gregory Polyakov, Christian Hepting, Carsten Eickhoff, Seyed Ali Bahrainian
> *To appear at EMNLP 2025*

We are currently preparing the public release. The repository will be updated soon.

## Installation

This project requires **Python 3.11**.

Install the main dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To use the **information flow routes** approach, you also need to install the `llm-transparency-tool` directly from its repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/llm-transparency-tool.git
pip install ./llm-transparency-tool
```
